	I am interested in Standalone IntelliJ inspections. When I am using IntelliJ to work on Java projects, I always find it user-friendly that it can warn me with potential runtime errors. Therefore, if the warnings could be extended to more complicated runtime errors, it can save so many time for user to debug and remind them to change their codes. Giving warning to style problem is also very important because as many people are working on the same project, a uniform and clean style gives everyone motivation and a good feeling to do the project.
